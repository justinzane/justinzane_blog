Summary: Cleaning and Waxing Bicycle Chains

# Chain Cleaning

One of the least glamourous parts of a bike is the chain; and one of the least fun tasks
in bike maintenance is cleaning and lubing one's chain. For the spendthrift and lazy, one
option is simply to replace the chain every time it gets grungy. For the rest, it is
necessary to &occasionally remove the chain, clean it, thoroughly lubricate it and
reinstall it.

I'm sure that there are dozens of effective ways to approach this task and I'm pretty
certain that my way is not the *right* way; just one of the good options. For those
interested in more detailed info, check out
[Sheldon Brown's take](http://sheldonbrown.com/chains.html) or read some of the topical
posts on [bikeforums](http://www.bikeforums.net/). For those who just want to get started,
read on...

## *Missing Links*

One **very** important thing to remember before you remove your chain is that you need to
replace it once it is clean and lubed! And, it is often impossible to securely replace
the chain without a replacement link and pin. That means that before you start you should
be very certain that you have a removeable link either on your chain now or immediately at
hand to use once you are done.

I've been using the *KMC Missing Link*
<img alt="*KMC Missing Link*" src="http://www.justinzane.com/images/KMC_MissingLink.jpg"/> and had good
results with it. However, I'm sure that Shimano, or any other brand of removeable link
will be just as satisfactory. The important thing, besides actually having one, is that you
get the appropriate type for your chain. Especially for 11 speed rear drivetrains,
compatibility between different brands and models is rather limited.

## Cleaning

I've found that doing the cleaning in two steps makes life a bit easier. The first step,
for chains that are really greasy and grimy is to use a generic degreaser, plastic "wire"
brush and hose to get the majority of the external gunk off the chain. Once it appears
mostly clean, it is time to really clean it.

Because the visible parts of the chain are generally not subject to much wear, to really
important part of chain cleaning is getting fine dirt, old lube and other tiny particle
out of the *inside* of the chain. The way I prefer to do this is by boiling the chain in
a small pot of water with a liberal dose of surfactant -- dish soap.

Generally speaking, it would be ideal to do this with an inexpensive 2 quart saucepan saved
for this task and not for food, though it is quite possible to clean a cooking pot if you
put in the effort.

To boil the chain clean, coil it flat in a single layer on the bottom of the pot and add
enough water to cover it at least half an inch. Use a fair amount of dish soap, perhaps
half a teaspoonful, in the water. The detergent "traps" any oil, grease, or dirt that
gets released so that it does not simply end up back in the chain.

Boil the chain vigorously for at least 10 minutes, being careful that you do not end up
with steamy suds boiling over. If, after the pot has been removed from the heat, the water
is almost clear of dirt or grease, you're done. If not, gently dump the dirty water and
repeat the process until grime stops coming out of the chain.

## Drying

Once the chain is clean, rinse it thoroughly in hot water to remove any traces of soap.
Then, pat it mostly dry with a clean shop towel. In order to keep corrosion to a minimum
it is a good idea to force dry it. Though using a hair dryer would likely work for the
fastidious, I find it easier to simply lay it in a single layer on a clean cookie sheet in
an over heated to just over the boiling point, say 225 &deg;F for 15-30 minutes. [*NOTE:
Don't use extreme heat, as that will alter whatever heat treatments have been used to
manufacturer the chain.*]

## Lubrication

There are a vast array of chain lubes available, some with quite excellent reputations.
My favourite, though, is simple paraffin wax. Wax has the distinct advantage of **not**
attracting dirt which is both aesthetically and practically nice. I've ridden a waxed
chain for approximately 250 miles and it looks almost as clean and shiny as it did the
moment I put it on the bike.

With any lube, wax or otherwise, it is essential that the lubricant get inside the
chain. The outside, visible parts of the chain need not have **any** lubricant at all;
the insides of the rollers **must** be lubricated. While the aforementioned Mr. Brown has
instructions on how to apply liquid lubricants properly, this is still less than ideal
since it relies on capillary action to pull lubricant inside the rollers and leaves quite
a bit of excess on the outside of the chain to attract dirt and grime and muck up one's
gears, too.

With paraffin wax -- the kind used for old-fashioned canning of jams -- it is obviously
necessary to melt it in order to get it into the chain. Any metal, glass or ceramic
container with a large enough bottom to hold the single-layer coiled chain and with
walls at least an inch and a half high will suffice. I used an old bread pan, but whatever
you choose, it is a good idea to dedicate it to chain waxing forever. Trying to empty the
excess wax is wasteful and difficult!

To melt the wax, I used the already preheated oven, at about 225 &deg;F. I put a couple
of blocks of paraffin into the pan and stuck it in the oven for a while until it was fully
melted. The amount needed will be determined by the depth needed to full submerge the chain
which will depend on your container and chain.

[*NOTE: As is obvious from paraffin wax's use in candles, it is flammable. Though it is
necessary to find specific documentation on the exact composition of wax you use, try to
avoid temperatures over 275 &deg;F. At and beyond this temperature the danger of vapor
ignition is significant. If using a small oven, it may be useful to place a cookie sheet
on the shelf below the pan to prevent hotspots from the heating element. And, don't stick
your face in the way when first opening the oven door. Any vapors or flame will be most
unpleasant!*]

Once the wax is liquid, gently lay the flat coiled chain into the wax and return it to
the oven. If you are using *Missing Links* or another replaceable link that will stay
attached to the chain during gentle manipulation, put those on before putting the chain
in the wax. Otherwise, simple drop them in the molten wax beside the chain. I simply left
it "steep" for about an hour whist I attended to other matters; the length of time is
simply to let the wax seep into all parts of the chain and replace any trapped air. To
aid in this I used a disposable barbecue skewer to gently move the chain around in the
molten wax, making sure that each link-joint flexed in both directions.

After being confident that the wax had penetrated all the internal spaces of the chain,
I spread a couple of layers of waxed paper on a heat resistant surface and using the
skewer(s) carefully lifted the chain out of the pan, trying not to shake any out of the
inside of the chain, but allowing the excess to drip off. Laying the chain on the paper
to cool, I again went about my business until it was no longer warm to the touch.

When picking up the chain, you'll notice that it is extremely stiff, the excess wax
resisting flexion. Making sure not to leave wax flakes all over the place, they are a
bitch to clean once stepped upon, simply start at one end of the chain and bend each link
fully in both directions. It may still feel a tad stiff, but that is OK. Pop it back on
the bike and ride on!
