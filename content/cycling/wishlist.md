# Bike Parts Wish List

While I love the *GMC Denali* branded road bike that I was given, I am quite aware of its 
limitations, being basically a department store POS. Fortunately, the 62cm frame seems to fit 
me quite nicely and just about everything else is replaceable. Following is what I would love to 
eventually have on that frame.

## Drivetrain

- Better spaced crankset
	- 50-34 compact double chainset for road use or if I get significantly stronger.
	- 50-36-26 triple for touring, shopping and road use
	- 175mm crank arms if replacement necessary or cheaper for chainrings. I've got 172.5 now.
- Better spaced rear: For me, at least in the near future, traditional *corncob* style road 
cassettes with very tight spacings, like a 12-21 10 speed, are pretty useless. I cannot feel the 
difference between anything much less than 10% and the value of truly low gears for going up 
hills without knee strain and very high for coming back down without excessive coasting is 
important. Especially with a double.
	- 11-13-15-18-21-24-28 7 speed *DNP Epoch* freewheel for existing freewheel hub
	- 11-12-14-16-18-20-23-26-30-34 10 speed Shimano/SRAM splined 10 speed cassette for new hub.
- 10 Speed chain for new hub.
- Shimano compatible 10 speed long-mid cage rear derailer
- Shimano/SRAM splined freehub
- Shimano compatible brifters (integrated brake and shift levers with drop bar mount)
- TT-bar dual brake lever(s) and shifters.
- Touring strength aluminum mid-profile rims, 32 hole, and solid or double-butted spokes.

## Comfort Parts

- 130-150mm wide split nose saddle. Need to do some sit testing to determine comfort in practice.
- Time Trial/Aero/Triathlon clip-on bars. Prefer separate left and right bars, not a solid "u" 
shape. Need to be able to adapt to different bar shape and size.
- Bite valve attachment for water bottles.
- Dual bottle cage.

## Miscellany
- Aluminum bashguard for triple crankset
- Dynamo hub, battery pack and USB charger
- Cadence sensor with Bluetooth output
- Heartrate sensor with Bluetooth output

## Clothing
- Cycling jacket: long tail, tight fitted, smooth finish, wind and water resistant
- Arm warmers
- Leg warmers
- Long tights with or without chamois.
- Cooling beanie
- Helmet cover
- Insulated neoprene gloves
- Insulated, wind and water resistant shoes
- Scratch resistant, photochromic, thin-top-frame, grey sunglasses
-
