# justinzane's Bicycle Drivetrain Survey

There are endless discussions on the web about the merits of seven or eight speed rears vs the 
newest 10 and 11 speed cassettes, chains, derailleurs and shifters. Same goes for internal 
geared hubs like the famous Sturmey-Archers, the Shimano *Alfine*s and the Rohloffs. Add in 
oddities like the NuVinci CVTs together with truly old-school fixie and single speeds and there 
is an entire universe of options to drive the rear wheel of a [safety bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_bicycle).

Then we have the seemingly endless discussions of road double vs compact double vs triple up 
front along with strange things like belt and shaft drives. With variable crank arm lengths the 
number of possible drivetrains -- (set of possible crank arm lengths) x (set of possible front 
cranksets) x (set of possible rear drives) -- on a something as seemingly simple as a bicycle is
truly enormous. 

Now, some of the web information, like that from the online bible of cycling, [sheldonbrown.com](http://sheldonbrown.com/gearing/index.html) or from really good forums like [Bike Forums](http://www.bikeforums.net/forum.php) is essential for understanding what the various options 
mean in practice. One thing that these sources lack, however, is current data on what is 
actually between the pedals and wheels of real bikes being ridden by real people day-to-day.

To address this lack of basic data, I created a [survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/L93MGJT) 
on SurveyMonkey to collect non-personal data on topic. Since I am not in any way commercially 
interested in this data or affiliated with anyone who is; there is no commercial purpose to this.
Rather it is simply a matter of curiosity and something that I hope to be able to contribute to 
the wider cycling community.

Please, if you know what you ride, take a moment to [fill it out](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/L93MGJT).

Then you can see the [current results](https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-Q5S8WKDL/).
