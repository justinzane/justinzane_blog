Title: Privacy Policy
##Privacy Policy

I take your privacy seriously. This policy describes what personal information I collect and 
how I use it. *This privacy policy is applicable to websites falling under the primary domain 
justinzane.com.*

###Routine Information Collection

All web servers track basic information about their visitors. This information includes, but is 
not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this 
information can personally identify specific visitors to this site. The information is tracked 
for routine administration and maintenance purposes, and lets me know what pages and information 
are useful and helpful to visitors. 

***I do not persistently sore any server log information; 
however, since the webserver is a long-running process and my site is very low traffic, log 
information may exist in server RAM for days.***

###Cookies and Web Beacons

Since this is a static blog, ***I do not use any cookies or similar tools.*** Everyone sees the
exact same site.

My advertising and analytics sources and other third parties do use cookies, scripts and/or web 
beacons to track visitors to our site in order to display advertisements and other useful 
information. Such tracking is done directly by the third parties through their own servers and 
is subject to their own privacy policies.

Though I would prefer to not include advertising, it helps defray the cost of hosting this blog.

###Controlling Your Privacy

Note that you can change your browser settings to disable cookies if you have privacy concerns. 
Disabling cookies for all sites is not recommended as it may interfere with your use of some 
sites. The best option is to disable or enable cookies on a per-site basis. Consult your 
browser documentation for instructions on how to block cookies and other tracking mechanisms.

###Ad Blocking

I am a fan of ad blocking, and I cannot blame anyone for using it. That said, I would appreciate
whatever revenue I can get to support this site and request that you enable ads while here.
