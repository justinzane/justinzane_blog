## Wow, There Really is a Hell -- Weed, CA!
### 110&deg;F in the shade, torturous everywhere.

Those who know me have already heard me complain (most likely many, many times ;)) that Weed, 
CA, USA is an aptly named outpost of hell. Well, now there's proof --  it hit 110&deg;F at my 
weather station. It is so damn hot that I am having to hose down the roof just so the air 
conditioner can keep the place below 88&deg;F.

This mercury misery, as much as I would like to blame the local rednecks, is actually the fault 
of serious hinkiness in the northern jet stream as you can see in the little animation from 
SFSU. 

As you can see, the jet stream which normally is continuous from west to east has basically 
broken into partially disjoint segments. There is one segment that comes almost straign down the 
east side of the Rockies from the US-CA border through Texas. This segment is preventing heat 
from moving across the country and this intense heat is just cycling aroung the southwest US.

The particular local misery right here in Weed/Hell is the result of air that has been heated 
and poluted all the way up the CA Central Valley. The only relative boon is that while most of 
central CA is from below sea level in Death Valley to a few hundred feet above in some cities, 
we are at ~2780ft above sea level. Adiabatic cooling has lowered the batshit-crazy 120-130&deg;F
temperatures down below to ***only*** 110.

Time to go hose the house again...
