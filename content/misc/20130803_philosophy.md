# Philosophers are Old Pigs, Dinosaurs Still Extinct

> Ever since Socratesâ€™ wife was painted as a jealous shrew by one of his pupils, women have had 
it tough in philosophy. Thinkers from Aristotle to Kant questioned whether women were fully 
capable of reason. Today, many in the field say, gender bias and outright sexual harassment are 
endemic in philosophy, where women make up less than 20 percent of university faculty members, 
lower than in any other humanities field, and account for a tiny fraction of citations in top 
scholarly journals. [NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/arts/colin-mcginn-philosopher-to-leave-his-post.html)

Frankly the disturbing thing about this article is that accredited universities still have 
philosophy departments at all. While this country struggles to maintain competitiveness with 
both EU nations and rising powers like China, India, Korea and the like; while US citizens have 
a higher rate of unemployment per year of education than ever before; we are tolerating 
publicly funded mental masturbation.

Not only does this cause a burden of unproductive debt for both students and taxpayers, it 
enforces the bullshit notion that erudite wankery is in any way on par with science, engineering 
or even simple productive trades.
