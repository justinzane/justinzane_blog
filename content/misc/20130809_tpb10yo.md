Summary: Happy Birthday Pirate Bay

# The Pirate Bay is 10 and Rising

In case you missed it, the coolest news of the day is [The Pirate Bay's](http://thepiratebay.sx/)
tenth birthday today. You can read a nice history of TPB at 
[torrentfreak](http://torrentfreak.com/the-pirate-bay-turns-10-years-old-the-history-130810/).

To me, one of the most interesting things to note is this little listing from Alexa's 
[Top 500 Sites](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/global).

#   | site 
:---|:-----------
1   | google.com
2   | facebook.com
3   | youtube.com (Google)
4   | yahoo.com
5   | baidu.com
12  | twitter.com
14  | google.co.in (Google)
15  | bing.com
17  | yandex.ru
55  | bbc.co.uk
66  | stackoverflow.com
**81** | **thepiratebay.sx**
83  | about.com
85  | aol.com
98  | netflix.com
103 | cnet.com
107 | reddit.com
109 | espn.com

As you can see, though TPB trails the biggies like Google, Baidu, Facebook, Yahoo!, etc. it now is 
a more popular site than AOL, a total giant ten years ago, NetFlix, CNet, Reddit, and ESPN. I 
find it very entertaining and quite positive that even with all the effort that NetFlix and Hulu 
have made in trying to make typical commercial content available online, The Pirate Bay is still 
more popular.

For those who support democracy, note that the world is voting with its feet -- the totally 
unrestricted content provided by Pirates is preferred. And, for those who think that markets 
make accurate valuations, note that "Hollywood" content has been shown to have **far less** 
monetary value than its producers are willing to admit.

Just to put that into visual perspective, compare the performance of thepiratebay.sx, hulu.com 
and netflix.com over the last three months (source alexa.com):

As you can see, even with the US initiated interference with The Pirate Bay's domain names, it 
has consistently been more popular that two of "Hollywood's" best hopes for continued relevancy.

It'll be very interesting to see whether continued desperate attempts to force protectionist 
copyright laws down the world's throat keep The Pirate Bay growing for ten more years.
