Summary: Bye Bye Monkey Boy - Ballmer Is Retiring

# Bye Bye Monkey Boy - Ballmer Is Retiring

Just like when they killed Krazy Kolonel Khaddafi, I got a little twinge of regret hearing the 
news that Microsoft's Chair-tossing Executive Officer, Steve Ballmer, is retiring. Like Khaddafi 
or Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, Ballmer had that insanely happy, blustering, bully persona that made
him quite interesting if not so successful.

Some may argue that he was quite successful, as Microsoft has a $70+ billion yearly revenue 
stream. However, that is not much of an achievement, considering that he started with the 
near monopoly on all consumer and SMB computing developed by Bill Gates. Just like GM kept its 
position as the world's largest car company for decades after it lost its leadership in 
engineering, manufacturing, brand, etx.; Microsoft has lived off a very large, but slowly 
evaporating gravy train.

        Ballmer bounded across the stage to gee up Microsoft's employees. The clip - which saw him

## During Ballmer's tenure, M$ managed to:

- **Lose search to Google**
    
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=Google,+Yahoo,+Bing+%2B+MSN&cmpt=q&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=500&h=330"></script>  
    
    Search is huge in two ways. First, hundreds of millions of people use Google daily -- to the 
    extent that *Google* has now become a commonly used verb, meaning "search the internet", in 
    the same way *Kleenex* has become a generic term for facial tissue. Becoming such an 
    integral part of daily life is an awesome achievement for a brand.  
    
    Secondly, search strings and result selection are a huge source of information about what is 
    actually important to people. Even fully anonymized, this allows Google to monitor the 
    socio-cultural pulse of the world's people all the time, in almost real time. The ability to 
    know what people want, when is priceless.
    
- **Lose mobile to Palm,then BlackBerry, then Apple, then Google**
    
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=Windows+Phone+%2B+Lumia,+Android+%2B+Nexus,+iOS+%2B+iPhone&date=8/2007+73m&cmpt=q&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=500&h=330"></script>
    
    Starting with the aptly abbreviated WinCE, Ballmer's Microsoft has been a continuous player 
    in the mobile device space for many years. And, they have consistently sucked at making 
    mobile operating systems. Even RIM/BlackBerry's extremely vigorous collapse is nothing 
    compared to the continuous mediocrity of Microsoft's mobile projects.
    
    > Then there was the Kin, the short-lived square-ish mobile phone with social networking 
    aspirations. In a move reminiscent of "The Cat in the Hat," in 2010, we were offered Kin 
    One and Kin Two. Like Thing One and Thing Two, the Kin was locked in a software box -- a 
    client-server architecture that didn't allow third-party apps -- although the hardware was 
    based on an ARM design. Verizon started selling Thing One and Thing Two in May 2010; 48 
    days later, Verizon gave up and sent all of its unsold Kins back to Microsoft.
    > 
    > Last month, Wired ran a series of [leaked internal Microsoft videos](http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/11/unreleased-internal-microsoft-videos-show-why-kin-crashed-and-burned/) 
    that show pre-release testing of the Kin, and the results were devastating: Testers couldn't 
    figure out how to perform even the most basic functions. If you bought a phone, you would 
    expect to be able to make a call with it, right? Silly mortals. Heaven only knows why 
    Microsoft continued the project. 
    > 
    > Apple's income from the iPhone currently exceeds Microsoft's income -- from all sources.
    [Woody Leonhard, InfoWorld](http://www.infoworld.com/print/210521)
    
- **Only tie Sony and Nintendo in gaming**
    
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=Wii+%2B+GameBoy,+PlayStation+%2B+PS3+%2B+PS4,+XBox&cmpt=q&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=500&h=330"></script>
    
    Not that this matters much, since gaming is steadily moving to mobile platforms.
    
- **Lose social to Facebook, Twitter, etc.**

- **Lose the *Browser Wars* to Mozilla and KDE**

    While M$ still has a large market share, they have had to give up their attempt to 
    "proprietarize" the internet, having adopted standards developed and promoted by others in 
    most recent versions of IE. *Webkit*, and its Chrome and Safari derivatives, based on KDE's 
    work, and FireFox have steadily lead developments in browsers and, with their presence on 
    mobile devices are poised to become the dominant browsers.
    
    > **Microsoft misstep No. 1: Internet Explorer 6**
    > Chances are good that more Windows computers have been infected via Internet Explorer 6 
    than by any other vector. Flash and Adobe Reader may come close, but IE6 is up there. 
    ActiveX, IE6's evil toady, deserves its own ring in developer hell.
    > 
    > In the process of deploying IE6, Microsoft ran afoul of U.S. antitrust laws. The 
    repercussions of the DoJ action resonated throughout Microsoft's product line for more than 
    a decade, driving all sorts of design decisions that were at least partially influenced by 
    antitrust concerns.
    > 
    > Microsoft lost an enormous amount of public goodwill over IE6. It's as if, suddenly, the 
    average Windows user started to understand that their computer was at risk because of a bad 
    piece of Microsoft software. Web developers did, and do, hate IE6, with its fussy quirks, 
    outright bugs, and absolute disdain for anything reeking of a standard. Microsoft took more 
    than five years to ship an upgrade -- most likely the biggest misstep of all. 
    [Woody Leonhard, InfoWorld](http://www.infoworld.com/print/210521)

- **Lose cloud to Linux**
    
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=%22Linux+Cloud%22,+%22Windows+Cloud%22,+%22Ubuntu+Cloud%22&date=today+12-m&cmpt=q&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=500&h=330"></script>  
    
    Note that this does not even include the Amazon-specific Linux distro widely used on their 
    cloud, not does it include Fedora, Debian, Centos, Arch, Oracle Linux, etc.

- **Only tie Oracle, IBM and FOSS in enterprise database**
    
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=SQL+Server,+Oracle,+MySQL,+DB2&cmpt=q&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_AVERAGES_CHART&export=5&w=500&h=330"></script>
    
- **Lose in the markets to almost everyone**
    
    Even discounting newcomers like Google, Facebook, and the undead Apple, Monkey Boy's M$ has 
    failed to keep pace with IBM or even the Dow. Presuming one cares nothing about technology 
    and is only motivated by greed, Ballmer has been a bummer.
    
- **Repeat the Windows ME fiasco and embarrass itself with Windows Vista and again with Windows 
8.**
    
    > Microsoft is preparing to reverse course over key elements of its Windows 8 operating 
    system, marking one of the most prominent admissions of failure for a new mass-market 
    consumer product since Coca-Cola’s New Coke fiasco nearly 30 years ago.  
    > ...  
    > Analysts warned that changing course would be a significant admission of failure for 
    Steve Ballmer, chief executive, who called the October launch of Windows 8 a 
    “bet-the-company” moment as Microsoft sought to respond to the success of Apple’s iPad.  
    > ...  
    > Richard Doherty, analyst at tech research firm Envisioneering, said: “This is like 
    New Coke, going on for seven months – only Coke listened better.” Coca-Cola dropped its 
    New Coke formula in response to a consumer backlash less than three months after launch.  
    > ...  
    > The combination PC and tablet software was widely panned by reviewers and has been 
    blamed by some analysts for worsening the slump in sales that has rocked the PC industry.

    <blockquote>The long view is useful here. Windows, along with Intel, got its clock cleaned by Apple and Google in the last decade. Their global market share of operating systems fell from 96 percent around 2000 to 35 percent in 2012. Apple and Google wedged their way into our laptops, phones, and tablets, while Microsoft saw its sliver of the mobile market decline between 2005 and 2012.

## I'd call that a failure. But some don't... 

> Anyone who describes outgoing Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's tenure as a "failure" is wrong. An 
annualized growth rate of 16 percent in a large, established company, selling into mature 
markets, is nothing to scoff at. Revenue tripled under his leadership; profits doubled. That's 
some failure. [Peter Bright, ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/microsoft-needs-a-new-ceo-who-probably-doesnt-exist/)

*Hmmm, margins falling by 33%... Not failure?*

> It's also not the case that Ballmer was simply riding high on the Windows and Office 
monopolies he inherited. .... During Ballmer's time as CEO, Microsoft Dynamics went from 
non-existent to a billion-dollar-a-year business. So too did SharePoint. So did Xbox. So did 
the System Center suite. So did Lync (formerly Office Communicator). So did Office 365. So did 
the Windows Azure cloud platform. [Peter Bright, ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/microsoft-needs-a-new-ceo-who-probably-doesnt-exist/)

*Let's see. I had using Dynamics well **before** Monkey Boy bought them out. And, though I've 
installed SharePoint dozens of times, I've never seen it actually **used**. SharePoint is the 
server equivalent of the preinstalled crapware on consumer PCs. And, System Center is nothing 
more than what Novell was offering fifteen years ago, riding on the Windows monopoly. As for the 
rest, I've covered it.*

> ... This growth includes the introduction of new features [to Windows Server] such as Hyper-V 
that have enabled Microsoft to go toe-to-toe with market leader VMware. [Peter Bright, ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/microsoft-needs-a-new-ceo-who-probably-doesnt-exist/)

*The phrase "market leader" is a sneaky way of excluding the real leaders in deployed virtual 
envirnments like KVM and Xen since they are **free** and open source and not in the market at 
all.*

> During Ballmer's time as Microsoft's CEO, the company grew. It diversified. It expanded into 
new markets, and it did so successfully. Ballmer enthusiastically promoted new directions like 
cloud computing, investing money to expand new businesses and giving the technical people the 
freedom and flexibility to implement the right solutions. Ballmer worked to actively expand 
Microsoft's reach, to strengthen its position and broaden its revenue base.
>
> It hasn't all been plain sailing, of course. Xbox has had a rocky road. The first model was 
cripplingly expensive to make, and it sold at a loss, as Microsoft worked to establish a 
beachhead in the console market. The second model suffered the Red Ring of Death reliability 
problem. The messaging and PR surrounding the imminent Xbox One has been nothing short of 
incompetent. [Peter Bright, ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/microsoft-needs-a-new-ceo-who-probably-doesnt-exist/)

*Selling at a loss to achieve market parity? Not failure?*

> Online, Microsoft still has many challenges ahead. Bing has become a credible search engine, 
but Online Services Division still loses money (though it's heading in the right direction). 
The $6 billion purchase of advertising and marketing firm aQuantive in 2007 turned into a $6 
billion write-off in 2012. [Peter Bright, ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/microsoft-needs-a-new-ceo-who-probably-doesnt-exist/)

*Continuing to lose money and relevance for a decade -- moving in the right direction?*

> Even in enterprise there are anomalies. The rise of BlackBerry (or RIM, as it then was) is 
remarkable. With Exchange, Microsoft had a strong position in corporate mail and related 
technologies. With the variously named iterations of Windows Mobile and Pocket PC, Microsoft 
had a mobile, smartphone operating system. The components were all there. And yet it wasn't 
Microsoft who provided a way for busy executives to have reliable, instant access to their 
Exchange mail wherever they went: it was BlackBerry. [Peter Bright, ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/microsoft-needs-a-new-ceo-who-probably-doesnt-exist/)

*And, since RIM/BlackBerry could not evolve beyond their dependence on M$ Exchange, they are on 
a stunningly rapid collision course with insolvency. Getting hooked on M$ proved fatal.*

> This was an enterprise market through and through, one concerned with remote management and 
security, one where Microsoft strengths such as support for Office documents could have been 
brought to bear. It was a market Microsoft should have completely owned. But it didn't. 
[Peter Bright, ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/microsoft-needs-a-new-ceo-who-probably-doesnt-exist/)

>... But consistently, under Ballmer's watch, the company failed to adapt and respond... 
[Peter Bright, ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/08/microsoft-needs-a-new-ceo-who-probably-doesnt-exist/)

You get the point. Mr. Bright does nothing more that try to fight through the major failures 
looking for tiny successes. Even as recounted by apologists, Monkey Boy's tenure has been less 
than stellar. 

While it is always compelling to blame him personally for the failures, I seriously doubt that 
that is the case. With Microsoft being as large, in employment and heirarchical terms, as the 
governments of a midsized nation, it is rather ridiculous to assume that Ballmer could coax much 
more out of a bureaucracy than any head of state. And, perhaps that is his biggest failure -- 
building rather than avoiding institutionalized hierarchies. 

> **Microsoft misstep No. 2: Management musical chairs**  
> I've talked about the Microsoft management musical chairs in a series of InfoWorld Tech Watch 
posts, most recently "Game of thrones: The men who would be Ballmer." Suffice it to say that 
all of the people capable of providing a steady transition from the reign of Ballmer have left 
the company.

> Jim Allchin. Brad Silverberg. Paul Maritz. Nathan Myhrvold. Greg Maffei. Pete Higgins. 
Jeff Raikes. J Allard. Robbie Bach. Bill Veghte. Ray Ozzie. Bob Muglia. Steve Sinofsky. They're 
all legends, in their own way, and Microsoft had many more. 
> 
> We still have some luminaries. Andy Lees survived the Sinofsky purge. Paul Maritz is still 
around, having spent years at VMware. Bill Veghte's at HP. There are others still at Microsoft, 
but most lack the experience to play in that league.

> The lack of senior management depth may turn out to be Microsoft's biggest misstep in the 
early 2010s. [Richard Waters, Financial Times](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/330c8b8e-b66b-11e2-93ba-00144feabdc0.html)

It may be unrealistic to assume that anyone would voluntarily turn away from the easy path of 
exploiting a monopoly position, but has Ballmer or Gates had the vision to see Windows/Office as 
nothing more than a big venture capital infusion for future products, Microsoft might well have 
eaten Apple's or Google lunch.

That same question remains for whomever gets the CEO gig next. Will they consciously and 
forcefully remit their hugely profitable legacy products to the corporate basement and focus on 
creation? Or will they be content to milk the cash cow 'til she runs dry?
