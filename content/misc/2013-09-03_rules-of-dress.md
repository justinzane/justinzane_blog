# Rules of Dress

0. **It is better to be overdressed than underdressed. It is, however, better to be underdressed 
than to be dressed like everyone else.**

1. Thou shall wear silver colored metal. This includes most metals that are not 
alloys of copper or gold. This applies to rings, watches, cufflinks, etc.

2. Thou shall wear black leather. This applies to shoes, belts, watches, etc.

3. Thou shall match socks with either pants or tie.

4. Thou shall wear a belt when wearing pants with belt loops.

5. Pocket squares shall be without bold patterns. 

6. Shoes shall be either laced or buckled.

7. Thou shall not wear a tie without a jacket; else thou runneth the risk of looking like a 
waiter at *TGI Fridays*.

8. Thou shall not wear suspenders (braces) ever. Except when dressed as *Paul Bunyan* and in the 
company of a blue ox.

10.  Thou shall only wear shirts with contrasting cuffs and collar if it has french cuffs.

11.  Thou shall utilize a pocket square when wearing a jacket. Pocket squares are underrated, 
underutilized.

12.  Thou shall not wear a back pack/book bag when in business dress, especially when in a suit. 
Book bags are reserved for casual wear and students. Plain black messenger bags or briefcases 
are recommended.

13.  Thou shall not wear a shirt with any type of logo on it in a business setting, including 
when in business casual dress.  These shirts should be reserved for casual wear.

14.  Thou shall not wear a tie bar.

15. Thou shall never button all three buttons of a three button jacket. Sometimes the top, 
always the middle and never ever ever the bottom.

16. It is impossible to be considered well dressed if one's shoes are in poor taste or of 
noticeably poor quality. For any good ensemble is built on a fine pair of shoes.

17. Thou shall not wear sport sunglasses with a suit. It’s like wearing socks with sandals; 
everyone else knows its wrong, why don’t you?

18.  Thou shall not wear a sports watch with a suit. It would be like playing lacrosse in dress 
shoes -- and nothing else -- and no one wants to see that.

19.  There should be no presence of logo or branding on clothing. For example, do not wear a 
Polo shirt with the Polo logo on it. The emphasis of clothing should be the wearer, not the 
maker.

20. **A man need not an excuse to wear a tie or jacket. In other words, a man need not an excuse 
to dress up.**
