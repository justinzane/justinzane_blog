## Dino$aur Evolution?

### Nature of the Beast

Though Microsoft has been making money hand over fist for years, much of its income is derived 
from the slow-to-change practices of large institutions. *Windows* is now a minority operating 
system as most of the worlds' people use mobiles not PCs; paralleling the shift from VMS, OS3xx
or Unix shared systems to PCs that signalled the rise of Microsoft initially. Similarly, products
like *Office*, *SQL Server*, *Exchange Server* and the like are used not because they are 
currently an ideal choice, but because the administrative difficulty and expense of continuing 
to use them is not yet great enough to change institutional habits.

The device world is a generally poor area for a company with the resources and persistence of 
Microsoft. The XBox line has been quite successful, but it has never developed any sort of 
hegemony. The WinCE line, from PocketPC through Win8, has always struggled. Microsoft's mobile 
products have ranged from solid-but-uninspiring through total garbage but never, never 
excellent.

Oh, and then there's [Bing](http://www.bing.com/). Perhaps the world's most effective way to 
lose money outside of invading Afghanistan.

As it stands now, there are very few, if any, really unique and indespensible products coming 
out of Redmond. Need an office productivity package, use [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org)
or [Google Docs/Drive](https://drive.google.com/). Need a RDBMS, use [MariaDB](http://www.mariadb.org/)
or [DB2](http://www.ibm.com/software/data/db2/). Need a smartphone, use 
[iOS](http://www.apple.com/) or [Android](https://play.google.com/). Need a search engine, 
[Google](http://www.google.com/). Need a game console, get at Sony 
[Playstation](http://www.playstation.com/), etc...

### Evolution?

> A couple of years ago, a satirical set of diagrams depicting the organization of Amazon, 
Apple, Facebook and other technology companies made the rounds on the Internet. The chart for 
Microsoft showed several isolated pyramids representing its divisions, each with a cartoon 
pistol aimed at the other. Its divisions will war no more, Microsoft said on Thursday. ... 
“To execute, we’ve got to move from multiple Microsofts to one Microsoft,” Mr. Ballmer said 
in an interview. 
[NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/technology/microsoft-revamps-structure-and-management.html?pagewanted=all)

Certainly this is the archtypical business school solution for any an all types of corporate 
malaise -- org-chart onanism. As the Times noted, there have been some long standing and 
notorious divisional battles within Microsoft. What is not at all clear is that these internecine 
scrums have been the root cause of the thorough lack of innovation and adaptation. A level of 
competition between internal teams can lead to the same Darwinian progress that competition 
between different businesses can.

It is also clear that having task-specific groups with low levels of heirarchy can lead to 
increased productivity. If anything, my observation is that Microsoft's deep management structure 
has what could be productive teams to waste energy through over-broad priority swings. Of course, 
this is also a result of Microsoft's closed source, shrinkwrapped distribution model. Instead of 
allowing individuals or teams to write, release, and update focused tools or libraries as soon 
as quickly as they can; everyone has to work around massive, multi-year release cycles. That, 
almost by definition, means that many developers and engineers will be idle while others will be 
pushed beyond their capacity for reliable quality.

I find it challenging to see what consolidation of a deep and wide heirarchy into a skyscrapingly 
deep and narrow one will do to address the core problems. Looking through the new list of 
"functional divisions" as provided by [ArsTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/):

> - Terry Myerson, formerly head of the Windows Phone team, will take charge of the Operating 
Systems Engineering Group. This group will manage all operating system development, from phone 
to console to PC to cloud. The team will also own certain core cloud services.
> - Julie Larson-Green, formerly head of Windows engineering, will take charge of the Devices 
and Studios Engineering Group. This group will manage the development and supply chains of all 
Microsoft devices, from mice to Xboxes, and will also be the home of all music, video, gaming, 
and entertainment teams.
> - Qi Lu, formerly of the Bing team, will run the Application and Services Engineering Group. 
This will house productivity and communication software (such as Office and Skype) and search.
> - Satya Nadella, formerly president of the Server and Tools division, will head the Cloud and 
Enterprise Engineering Group. This group will own data center and database software. It will 
also continue to be responsible for developer tools.
> - Eric Rudder, formerly chief technical strategy officer, will lead the Advanced Strategy 
and Research Group, focusing on new technology trends and trustworthy computing.
> - Tami Reller, formerly the chief marketing officer and chief financial officer in the 
Windows division, will lead a new Marketing Group that will also centralize all advertising.
> - Tony Bates, formerly Skype CEO, will run the Business Development and Evangelism Group, 
both working on partner relationships (such as those with Nokia, Yahoo, and PC OEMs) and 
evangelism and developer outreach.
> - Amy Hood will continue as chief financial officer, and the Finance Group will now 
centralize all finance operations that were previously managed within each division.
> - The Dynamics division will continue to stand somewhat apart from the rest of the company 
due to what Ballmer calls its need for "special focus."
> - Human Resources (which will continue to be led by Lisa Brummel) and 
> - Legal and Corporate Affairs (which retains Brad Smith as General Counsel) will remain in 
much the same form as they take today. 
> - Similarly, Kevin Turner will continue as COO, overseeing worldwide sales, stores, IT, 
and licensing operations.
>
>Ballmer also announced some other personnel changes. Kurt DelBene, president of the Office 
division, will be retiring. Craig Mundie, who has been serving as advisor to Ballmer, will now 
devote all his time to a "special project." Rick Rashid, formerly chief research officer and 
head of Microsoft Research, will now move into the OS engineering group to drive core OS 
innovation.

Well, it seems that Microsoft's fundamental problem is that its CEO cannot count. OS, Devs, 
Apps, Cloud, Research, and Dynamics seems to add up to **six** functional groups. :) Seriously,
though, this does not seem to change the likelyhood of conflict between divisions over resources 
or strategy. Just consider that *Cloud* computing, a complete techno-babble marketing term to 
impress the ignorant to start with, will be shared between OS and Cloud/Enterprise divisions. 
This helps how? From the PR text, this seems like nothing more than moving pins on the Itanic.

>In addition to describing the new groups within the company, Ballmer also outlined Microsoft's 
new way of working. He emphasized five adjectives: nimble, communicative, collaborative, 
decisive, and motivated. Microsoft has already started down this path with Windows 8.1. Major 
products, such as Windows and Office, will have teams that span the different engineering 
groups, so they will draw technology from all these groups. [ARSTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/)

Wow, complete MBA gibberish. After all, the "old Microsoft" and most other technology companies 
strive to be sluggish, flighty, depressed hermits, right? Oh, and Windows 8.1 is ***not*** just 
an attempt to recover from the utter fiasco that is Window 8 and 5+ consecutive quarters of 
declining PC sales. How anyone could say that with a remotely straight face is beyond my 
comprehension.

>For most of the company, this represents a major organizational and cultural shift, and it 
won't take place overnight. Ballmer said that the reorganization process will take at least 
until the end of the calendar year. [ARSTechnica](http://arstechnica.com/)

Right, since being a developer down at level 12 of the "Office" division is so much different than 
being at level 13 of the "Apps" division. 

My guess is that it will take between 2 and 5 years until things reach enough of a crisis for 
real change. Change being the spin-off of underperforming bits of the company in the same way 
that IBM has gotten rid of its consumer computing, [Lenovo](http://www.lenovo.com/), and 
rotational storage, HGST, divisions. 

I would assume that gaming and devices and enterprise software would split into separate entities
with crap like Bing being parcelled off to whatever entities what the deeply discounted corpses. 
Whether a separate devices company could recover enough to compete is uncertain, but losing the 
rest of Microsoft would help. In the enterprise arena, there is enough room -- read as enough 
ignorant CTOs -- for products like Win Server, SQL Server, etc. to survive and be profitable as 
just another option to IBM, Oracle, SAP and the like.

We shall see.
