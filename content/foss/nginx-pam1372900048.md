Summary: Using PAM for nginx auth

## Nginx & PAM

As you can see [here](http://web.iti.upv.es/~sto/nginx/), a very nice person has written a 
module to allow nginx to do HTTP Basic Authentication against just about any backend that PAM 
can handle. Since [PAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_authentication_module) can use 
most anything that is at all common, from `/etc/passwd` to LDAP to SQL, this makes life much 
easier on the sysadmin.

Though I did not find it documented anywhere, the pam module **is** included int the `nginx-extras`
package on Ubuntu based distros. Again, for Ubuntu based systems, I used the following config:

`/etc/pam.d/nginx`
    
    @include    common-auth
    @include    common-account

`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` or `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/sitename`

    :::nginx
    location / {
        auth_pam                "Secure Zone";
        auth_pam_service_name   "nginx";
        ...
    }
    
I'm using this on a small home LAN, so generic *nix auth works for me. By adapting the 
`/etc/pamd.d/nginx` configuration, you should be able to do whatever you need. And, there are 
tons of example pam setups for other apps, so inspiration should be easy.
