# Goons of Islam - Tribute to Ahmadinejad

I'm somewhat sad to see the term-limited Mahmoud Ahmadinejad leave the Presidency of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran. Whatever else political scientists, historians and Ayatollahs have to 
say about him, he was a supremely entertaining character. 

*Persianlaugh* has a [little compendium of Ahmadinejad jokes](http://persianlaugh.com/mahmoud.html) 
relating to his speech at Columbia University. Some of the keepers:

> "Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that there are no homosexuals in Iran. By the way, that's why in 
Iran, it's nearly impossible to get your dog groomed." --David Letterman
>
> " Hey, maybe if there were homosexuals in Iran, he'd be better dressed" --Jimmy Kimmel 
>
> "The president of Iran gave a speech in New York City today, and thousands of New Yorkers are 
really upset about it. The New Yorkers said, 'If we want to hear a short-tempered Iranian man 
yell at us, we'll take a cab.'" --Conan O'Brien 

Some other gems:

> Hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad took an unbeatable lead in Iran's presidential vote on Saturday, 
official results showed.  Ahmadinejad's victory is attributable to a key endorsement he received 
last week from Mel Gibson. [Gary Bachman](http://www.jokeblogger.com/hottopic/Mahmoud-Ahmadinejad)

> “Today wherever we go, waves of people express their love for the Islamic Republic and our 
dear Supreme Leader; even in Europe and the US. If they do away with censorship, it will become 
clear how the people of the world are enamoured of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the path of 
the Iranian nation.” [President Ahmadinejad](http://www.zamaaneh.com/enzam/2010/04/ahmadinejad-calls-for-dig.html)


In honor of President Imanutajob, I slightly altered the Dead Kennedy's "Goons of Hazzard":
