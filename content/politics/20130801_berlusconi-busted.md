Summary: Berlusconi Finally Gets Busted

# Berlusconi's Busted

> For years, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi deftly navigated the labyrinth of Italian 
justice, always finding an exit — until Thursday, when Italy’s highest court handed him his 
first definitive sentence, upholding a prison term for tax fraud and sending Italy’s fragile 
government on the road to crisis.

Italy's political scene has always had more than a touch of the circus, now almost literally 
with Beppe Grillo's entrance into the fray, but Silvio Berlusconi's utter disregard for the law 
and his apparent sense of god-like entitlement have been way beyond the comical. It is nice to 
see that he is finally being brought down and removed from public life.

Though I doubt it, this may signal a shift in the Italian polity's tolerance for graft and 
general scumbaggery in politicians and public figures. We'll see.
