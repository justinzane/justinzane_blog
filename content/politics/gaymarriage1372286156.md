Summary: Justice Kennedy Bonks Bible-Thumpers with Constitution

## Justice Kennedy Bonks Bible-Thumpers with Constitution

With both the conservative four, Scalia, Alito, Thomas and Roberts, and the liberal four, 
Sotomayor, Ginsberg, Breyer and Kagan, voting as expected, Justice Anthony Kennedy's *swing 
vote* overturned both DOMA and CA Prop 8. While this is certainly appropriate given the strong 
and consistent shift in public opinion, it strikes me as a bit surprising for the current court
which has been of an overall conservative bent.

To me, one of the best things about these rulings is that they remove a useless and distracting
*hotbutton* issue from future campaigns. The impact of gay marriage to the overall state of our 
Union is rather tiny compared with issues like regressive tax policies or the erosion of civil 
rights by fear-based security legislation and secrecy.

By making clear that religious persecution of minorities through legislation is not acceptable,
Kennedy has given the political process a nudge in the direction of substance over Bible-thumping.
While the effects of this decision on political discourse will take time, I hope that by the 2016
campaign there will be one less social issue wasting the words of politicians and pundits across
the nation.
