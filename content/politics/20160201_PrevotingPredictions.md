# It's Gonna Be All NY?!?!?

So, it is hours before the Iowa Caucuses. Time to lay out my predictions and thoughts. 

## Democrats

WRITEME

    1 - 85% Hillary Clinton. 
    
        Aside from perhaps Lindsey Graham, Clinton vastly more 
        experienced than any of the rest of the candidates on any side. If she is not our next 
        president, I'll be surprised.
    
    2 - 14% Bernie Sanders. 
    
        I love him, but I'm not sure that enough Americans are fully 
        convinced that capitalism in its current form has run its course. For anyone old enough to 
        remember the cold war, capitalism has become almost totemic. I'm also concerned that 
        Sanders would not be able to govern, since the House will almost certainly stay dominated 
        by those who have to worry about electoral challenges from the right.
    
    3 - 0% Martin O'Malley. 
        I remember years ago when he was the "next big thing" 
        for the Democrats. His ship has sailed.
    
## Republicans

    1 - 75% Donald Trump. 
    
        I'm not someone who would vote for _The Donald_ ever. That said, I've been __really__ 
        enjoying his campaign and his effect on the whole race. As someone who might be best 
        described as economic-philosophy-agnostic; I certainly do not agree with him on much 
        economic policy. I'm also for encouraging as many Syrian and Iraqi immigrants as the 
        world largest economy can surely manage, so I don't agree with him there.
        
        I do enjoy, however, his obvious enjoyment of campaigning. He is the one candidate 
        to whom this is more fun than work. That happiness and ebullience is, in my opinion, 
        one of the most under-analyzed aspects of the Trump Affair, 2016. 
    
    2 - 10% John Kasich. WRITEME
    
    3 - 10% Marco Rubio. WRITEME
    
    4 - 1% Chris Christie. WRITEME
    
    5 - 1% Jeb Bush. WRITEME
    
    6 - 1% Ted Cruz. WRITEME
    
    7 - ???. WRITEME
    
    8 - ???. WRITEME
    
    9 - 0% NY Gov. ??? . WRITEME
    
    10 - 0% Rick Santorum. WRITEME
    
    11 - 0% Mike Huckabee. WRITEME
    
    12 - 0% Rand Paul. WRITEME
    
    13 - 0% Carly Fiorina. WRITEME
    
    14 - 0% Bobby Jindhal. WRITEME
