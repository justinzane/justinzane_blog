# Bad Sign for the New York Times

![Nate Silver](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Nate_Silver_2009.png/300px-Nate_Silver_2009.png)

[Nate Silver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver), author of the 538 blog, currently at 
[http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/](http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/) 
and formerly at its own domain, has been the premier source of statistically honest and 
accurate political reporting for the past two election cycles. By relying solely on relevant, 
reliable data and thoroughly valid and reliable statistical methodology, Mr. Silver has 
repeatedly shown the hype and spin from campaigns and pundits, often repeated almost verbatim by 
news outlets, to be a very poor indicator of the likely outcomes of elections.

> That's according to the Times' own public editor, Margaret Sullivan, who today offered a 
strikingly honest assessment about the newsroom's attitudes toward a colleague she otherwise 
described as kind and "thoroughly decent." 
>
> "I donâ€™t think Nate Silver ever really fit into the Times culture and I think he was aware 
of that," Sullivan wrote on her blog today. "A number of traditional and well-respected Times 
journalists disliked his work."
>
> The news comes as Silver prepares to move from the Times to ESPN and ABC News,...
>
> Comparing Silver to Brad Pitt's character in Moneyball, Sullivan writes that Silver's 
"entire probability-based way of looking at politics ran against the kind of political 
journalism that The Times specializes in: polling, the horse race, campaign coverage, analysis 
based on campaign-trail observation, and opinion writing, or 'punditry,' as he put it, famously 
describing it as 'fundamentally useless.'"

The *New York Times*, like just about every newspaper on the planet, has been suffering through 
a period consistently declining subscription and ad revenue due the dramatic changes in the 
media landscape. This has, unfortunately, forced the *Times* to make very tough decisions about 
hope to reduce expenses which has cost the paper some of its bureaus and many journalists. 
Though the changes have generally been managed as well as one would expect from one of the world's 
oldest and best newspapers, they have damaged the paper nonetheless.

Since the variety of outlets for opinion and punditry have grown exponentially with the proliferation 
of cable "news" and politically oriented blogs and websites, it is hard for even the biggest, 
wealthiest and most respected publications and the pundits they employ to stand above the din. 
Similarly, the availability of global data networks has enabled organizations like 
[Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/), the [AP](http://www.ap.org/), [Bloomberg](http://www.bloomberg.com/) 
and the like to have almost instantaneous reporting on any significant (and many trivial -- 
Royal Baby, etc.) event anywhere on the planet. 

To me, the means that the key niche for publications like the *Times*, *The Guardian*, etc. is 
to provide more detailed, deeply informative, highly reliable reporting than the news agencies 
provide while avoiding the cheap opinion slinging that is nearly ubiquitous on cable TV and the 
web. The recent [coverage](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/business/a-shuffle-of-aluminum-but-to-banks-pure-gold.html?pagewanted=all) 
of Goldman's dastardly, deceitful, but legal exploitation of the storage and transshipment of 
bulk aluminum is a perfect example of what the *Times* does best.

As you can see from the Google News snapshot, the insanely premature political wanking over the 
**three years from now** potential candidacy of Hilary Clinton is being covered by every 
broadcast, cable, print and digital outlet imaginable. The *New York Times* article, while 
likely better written and edited than most, is lost in the sea of blather. If the *Times* tries 
to economise and compete based on this type of content, even the sterling reputation of the 
*Grey Lady* will eventually fail to draw an audience. 

I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that the few remaining bastions of excellence in 
journalism strive constantly to provide reliable, relevant and thorough content. Twenty years from 
now, when *Fox News*, *CNN*, *MSNBC*, *ABC News*, *CBS News*, *Al Jazeera* and *Xinhua* have 
merged into just two entities; when Clear Channel's AM talking heads, Limbaugh, Hannity, etc., 
are just audio streams on [Red State](http://www.redstate.com/) on some other site; when 
printed broadsheets are as archaic as floppy disks; quality reporting, streamed to your Google 
Contacts will be in high demand.

Whether that quality coverage is written by Nate Silver or someone of equal expertise and 
loquacity does not much matter. That real, reliable reporting and accurate analysis is written 
is critical. If the *Times* chooses to replace Silver with yet another pundit or 
spin-transcriber, it jeopardizes one of the cornerstones of American journalism.
