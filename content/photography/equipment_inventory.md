Summary: An inventory of my photography gear.

# Photography Gear Inventory

Partial inventory of my photography kit. May or may not ever be finished...

## Shameless Shilling

There are a lot of good places to buy and sell used photography gear. [Adorama](http://www.adorama.com/),
[B&H](http://bhphotovideo.com), and [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) are all good. My favorite,
though, is [KEH](http://www.keh.com/). Greap prices, excellent service, reliable and trustworthy.

## Bodies

- Nikon D200, 10.2MP, APS-C, focus motor, iTTL

- Nikon D70, 6MP, APS-C, focus motor, iTTL
    
    Currently having issues with CF socket losing contact with card during operation, leading to
    corrupt FAT FS. 

- Nikon N6006, 35mm film, film door broken.

- Panasonic DMZ-FZ100

## Lenses

- **SOLD** Tamron 80-210 f/4.5-5.6 AF, SN:146234, with hood

    ![Tamron 80-210 AF](images/tamron_80-210-AF.jpg)

- Sigma 70-300 f/4.0-5.6 AF DL Macro

    ![Sigma 70-300 f/4.0-5.6 AF DL Macro](images/sigma_70-300-macro.jpg)

- Sigma 18-50 f/3.5-5.6 AF DC HSM (58mm filter), SN:1007160, Japan

    This is an excellent lens, solid as a rock, quick focusing, absolutely wonderful. When 
    compared to some of the Nikon/Nikkor cheap kit lenses in the same price range, I'm very 
    glad to have this one.

- **SOLD** Nikkor 35-80 f/4-5.6 AF D (52mm filter), SN:NA, Thailand

    Not one of Nikon/Nikkor's finest. Perfectly functional, but it is flimsily built, has a slow
    max aperture, limited zoom and no wide angle on APS-C cameras.

- **SOLD** Nikkor 55 f/3.5 Micro non-AI, with M2 ring, SN:248360, Nippon Kogaku Japan
    
    ![Nikkor 55 f/3.5 Micro non-AI](http://www.photosynthesis.co.nz/nikon/f5535c.jpg)
    
    Super simple design, built like a tank. Reminds me of the old-school, pre-Fiorina, HP 
    LaserWriters. Completely mechanical and not suitable for use on any sort of modern Nikon
    body without physical upgrade with an [AI kit](http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/nikortek.htm#aid).

- **SOLD** Nikkor 28 f/3.5 non-AI, SN:651788, Nippon Kogaku Japan

## Lens Accessories

- **SOLD** Cosmos NT Auto Teleplus 2x Teleconverter, *AI aperture dial connector missing*

    This seems to be the same as the Kenko. Works very well with an all manual setup. I used it
    with a Celestron 400mm f/5.0 scope on both film and digital bodies and it was great for that.
    Not recommended for use with fast sharp lenses for typical photography. Buy an modern AF TC 
    that properly process lens focus data for the body so that metering and EXIF data work.

- **SOLD** Nikon HN3 52mm Lens Hood, with 52mm internal filter ring for 35mm+ lenses.

## Lighting

- Opteka EF 750 DG Super i-TTL Nikon Dedicated, GN:45m@ISO100, SN:, 4xNiMH-AA-1.2v

    Exceptionally powerful for the price. Plastic body, as solid as one can expect for a $30.00 
    flash. Does not appear to be able to work as part of a wireless iTTL group. Can work as an 
    optical slave. Works well as an on-shoe TTL flash with the caveat that it is fussy about 
    contact alignment. If you get extreme overexposure and lack of sync, just gently readjust it
    in the shoe.

- Panasonic Lumix TTL Shoe Flash DMW-FL220, GN:22m@ISO100, SN:0901018, 2xAA1.5v

    Awesome little flash, not compatible with the Nikon iTTL cameras I prefer, but totally 
    excellent otherwise. Very solid, reasonable fast recharge, uses standard 1.2-1.5v AA which 
    allows the use of cost-effective and environmentally friendly rechargeable NiMH cells.

## Filters

- Tiffen 52mm 2A (Haze)

- Tiffen 52mm Circular Polarizer

- Tiffen 52mm UV Protection, *external thread ring bent*

- Vivitar 52mm Cross Screen

    Excellent effect filter for portrait/still life shots in angular light.
