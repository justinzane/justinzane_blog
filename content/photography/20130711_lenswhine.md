Summary: Whining About Lenses

# Lens Whine

No, this is not an article about the virtue of silent focus motors. It is just (inzane) whining 
about the annoying dichotomy between the starter/consumer class lenses and the pro lenses 
that is consistent across make and fit throughout the SLR market. I am not a professional who can
expense or otherwise pass on the cost of four to five figure equipment purchases. However, I am 
a moderately serious, experienced amateur who is fighting with the limits of cheap lenses.

There is an article, [Is It Necessary to Buy the Expensive Lenses?](http://improvephotography.com/967/difference-cheap-expensive-lens-camera-dslr/) 
that presents the "Benefit[s] of Professional Lenses". I'll go through their points individually.

> 1. **Maximum Aperture.** This is probably the most important benefit of an expensive lens.  Most 
low-end lenses have max apertures of f/5.6 at the long end of the lens; however, professional 
lenses often have max apertures of f/2.8 or even lower. The large apertures offered by 
professional lenses aides in creating shallow depth of field and light-gathering.

This is really my biggest concern. Just like that "500x" toy store 25mm telescope is almost 
impossible to use, most consumer grade f/5.6 telephotos are very challenging in the conditions I
tend to use them in. They almost mandate a tripod in anything besides full daylight since it is 
near impossible to politely light subjects at a distance that requires a 300mm lens. Additionally,
since just about all AF sensors require sufficient contrast, they focus slowly or not-at-all in 
indoor or well-shaded conditions.

My [Sigma 70-300mm F/3.5-5.6 DG Macro](http://www.sigmaphoto.com/product/70-300mm-f4-56-dg-macro) 
is awesome, especially considering the price. I've taken hundreds of good pictures and a few dozen 
excellent ones with this lens. The only complaint I have about it is the very slow f/5.6 at 300mm.
Capturing baby 'coons -- nice fuzzy, bouncy, little low-contrast beasts -- when they are playing 
around in the eight o'clock shadows is almost impossible without something at least f/4.0.

Same deal with trying to get handheld snaps of a speaker in a darkened auditorium. Not impossible,
but it requires boatloads of junk frames to get a good one. Oh, that and serious underexposure 
that gets somewhat mitigated in raw post-processing. What would give me the most new opportunities 
is something that is no slower than f/4 and preferably f/2.8-3.3 **at** 300mm.

My great little Sigma is currently $144.00 at [Adorama](http://www.adorama.com/SG70300DLNKA.html?gclid=CMqik-eqsLgCFYZ_QgodPRoAlg) while
the drool-worthy [Sigma 120-300mm f/2.8 EX DG OS APO HSM](http://www.adorama.com/SG120300OSNK.html) 
is \<sarcasm\>only $2599.00\</sarcasm\>. So, 2 stops more light (4x) costs **18** times more! 
Looking at the strict proportions, the f/2.8 lens should cost $576.00. Saying that another way, 
my cheap lens costs $12 per unit of aperture area while the pro lens costs $50 for the same 
metric. 

Somehow, I do not think that the cost of grinding the larger glass counts for all that extra 
expense. Rather, the tolerances are much tighter, the coatings are better, the motor and case are
better and the profit margins are much better. I really wish that I could find a lens with similar
overall build quality as the entry level lenses but with big glass and a big hole.

> 2. **Constant Aperture.** Most cheap lenses change the max aperture as you zoom out.  For example, 
the popular Canon 75-300mm lens can achieve an aperture of f/4 at 75mm, but when you zoom out 
to 300mm, the lens can only achieve an aperture of f/5.6.  On many professional lenses, the 
maximum aperture available on a lens is constant throughout the focal length range.  For example, 
the 70-200mm lens by both Canon and Nikon can achieve an aperture of f/2.8 at the 70mm or 
200mm ends.

While that may make a difference to someone shooting with a fully manual setup, any reasonable 
modern body seems to deal with the fractional apertures just fine. And, I'd rather have an 
f/2.8-4.0 than a straight f/4.0 zoom all other things being equal. Not important.

> 3. **Focus Motor.** More expensive lenses use a silent wave motor, which produces faster and 
quieter focusing.

Many, many of my pictures are of animals and the impact of focus noise, when it comes to disturbing 
the subject, is thoroughly trivial. The appearance of a strange smelling, bizarrly vertical, 6'3" 
cyclops is going to scare anything away far sooner than the sound of a focus motor that is 4 
inches from the photographer's ear but many feet from the subject. I would pay a couple grand 
for *+1 elven boots* that would let me sneak up on critters. I could care less about going from 
20dB to 10dB when focusing.

> 4. **Weather Sealing.** While all lenses have a certain amount of weather sealing, high-end 
lenses have loads of it. ...

One of the things that I love about my D70 is that I do not stress if it starts to drizzle. I've 
never had schmutz mess up the optics of a cheap lens; but, I have had the zoom and focus mechanisms
get rough from dust and grit. All told, while it might be worth a 5-10% premium, it is not worth 
more to me since I am not likely to find myself on a months long expedition down the Amazon.

> 5. **Sharpness.** Kind of self-explanatory, but pro lenses are almost always sharper. ...

Buy me a nice [BetterLight](http://www.betterlight.com/eModels.html) back and an 
[Epson 9890](http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/jsp/Pro/SeriesStylusPro78909890) and I'll start 
stressing about lens sharpness. I'd much rather have the fast and accurate autofocus that comes 
with a larger aperture than crazy optical sharpness. 

As an aside, Ken Rockwell, who I have found to be quite a reliable pro photographer and writer 
over the years, has this to say about [lens sharpness](http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/lens-sharpness.htm):

>Sharpness is the most overrated aspect of lens performance. Lens sharpness seems like it ought 
to be related to making sharp photos, but it isn't. 
>
>Sales and marketing departments fuel this misconception because it scares people into buying 
new lenses. Sharpness is easy to test and analyze, so magazines oblige less experienced 
photographers with reams of colorful charts and graphs. People would make far better pictures 
if they spent time learning how to make great photos with what they already own instead of 
worrying about their tools.
>
>Photographic lenses, used properly, have always been sharp, even at the dawn of photography in 
the 1840s. Optical design is a much older science than photography. The reasons some photos 
aren't sharp rarely have anything to do with the lens. 
>
>... Even when I started with 35mm as a kid in the 1970s, I knew that you had to print at 
20x30" (50x75cm) in order to see any lens limitations. It was easy for me to see things on my 
transparencies under my microscope or with my slide projector that simply didn't make it to 
8x12" prints.
>
>In real-world photography, natural factors do more to screw up a picture than any lack of 
lens sharpness. Sharpness tests are unlike real photos because a test does everything possible 
to eliminate any source of unsharpness. In a lab, nothing moves and the target is usually flat. 
Only corn dogs use cameras to photograph flat test charts; smarter people stick flat charts in 
a $50 scanner for better results!
>
>In reality, everything moves, and nothing is flat. If nothing is flat, then only one point is 
in perfect focus while the rest isn't. Therefore, there may be no real plane of perfect focus, 
because most lenses have saggital and meridional (imaginary) planes of perfect focus which 
diverge. Planes of perfect focus are usually different for different colors, all this
gobbledygook meaning that there is no single real plane of perfect focus anyway. 

When I am considering purchasing a lens, I do **not** look at the goofy sharpness diagrams 
provided by OEMs or the insane 1:1 crops on fan sights. After all, even my relatively 
ancient D70's 3000x2000 pixels have to be reduced 50% or more to be useable for on screen 
viewing. Accurate low-light autofocus is vastly more important than sharpness in handheld 18x24mm
to 24x36mm sensor SLR photography. 

> 6. **Internal Focus.** On cheaper lenses, the physical length of the lens extends as you zoom 
in.  On many professional lenses, the lens focuses without changing the length of the lens. ...

Filters are to be used in the [gimp](http://www.gimp.org/), not on the lens. To me, lens filters 
are a relic of the days of film negative to print. With a digital workflow, who cares. The only 
value I've been able to notice with internal focusing is that accidentally supporting the lens 
with a finger under the barrel does not cause chaos with AF-C use.

> 7. **Contrast.** Professional lenses often produce significantly more saturated colors than 
cheaper lenses.

Again, totally a relic of film. Bogus!!!

> 8. **Chromatic Aberration.** Professional lenses produce less-noticeable fringing around edges. ...

This actually matters. But, again, if the lens is too slow to get the shot in the first place, it
doesn't matter how theoretically perfect it might be. Give me a fast lens with the same CA as my
cheap Sigma and I'll be happy.

> 9. **Color.** The difference in color reproduction is slight, but professional lenses do a bit better.

See #7. Bogus!!!

Aside from the frustration of not being able to find what I want, I am perplexed by the 
product positioning from the major vendors. While just about every DSLR maker has a line ranging 
from the entry level -- like Nikon's D40 and D3X00 bodies -- through the "prosumer" -- like 
Nikon's D70, D90 and D7x00 bodies -- to the serious professional -- like Nikon's 
D1 / D2 / D3 / D4 cameras. The big two, Canon and Nikon have split their lines into so many 
sub-segments that it seems quite excessive.

With lenses, though, there is a clear dichotomy between the $1000-25000 range targeted at pros 
and the plastic super-hyper-mega zooms targeted at schmucks that want to show off their 
expensive, classy DSLR but are too lazy or incompetent to make use of the ability to use 
appropriate lenses for difference shots. The competent hobbyist or semi-pro has an endless choice 
of camera bodies designed just for them, but nearly no lenses. WTF?
